        <h2>Anatomical Position</h2>

            <div>
                In the anatomical position, the human body is standing upright with feet together, arms at the sides, and the head, eyes, and palms facing forward. This position is used as a standard reference in the medical and anatomical fields to ensure clarity and consistency when describing the location and relation of body parts to one another. By maintaining a uniform point of reference, healthcare professionals can communicate more effectively, avoiding ambiguity and ensuring precise understanding across various contexts and specializations. This position serves as the baseline from which other movements and positions are measured.

        <h2>Anatomical Directions</h2>

                Anatomical directions are terms used to describe the locations and relationships of different body parts in a precise manner. <strong>Anterior</strong> refers to the front of the body, while <strong>posterior</strong> indicates the back. <strong>Lateral</strong> is used to describe structures further from the midline, whereas <strong>medial</strong> refers to those closer to the midline. <strong>Superior</strong> denotes a position above or higher than another part of the body, and <strong>inferior</strong> means below or lower. <strong>Rostral</strong> and <strong>caudal</strong> are terms often used in embryology or vetrinary medicine, with rostral referring to a position towards the head and caudal towards the tail or lower part of the body. For the hand, <strong>palmar</strong> indicates the palm side and <strong>dorsal</strong> refers to the back side. Similarly, for the feet, <strong>plantar</strong> describes the sole of the foot, and <strong>dorsal</strong> refers to the top side.

        <h2>Anatomical Planes</h2>
        <div class="mt-3">

            <div>
                Anatomical planes are imaginary lines used to divide the body into sections for descriptive and diagnostic purposes. The <strong>frontal</strong> plane (also known as the coronal plane) divides the body into front (anterior) and back (posterior) sections. The <strong>sagittal</strong> plane splits the body into left and right parts, with the midsagittal plane dividing it equally in the middle. Lastly, the <strong>transverse</strong> plane (or horizontal plane) cuts the body into upper (superior) and lower (inferior) portions. A handy way to remember these planes by their first letters is: Frontal (front), Sagittal (side), and Transverse (top). This mnemonic device helps reinforce the association between each plane and its respective orientation in the body.
